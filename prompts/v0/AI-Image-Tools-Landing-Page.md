# FluxScale AI Landing Page

## Prompt

Create a modern, sleek landing page for FluxScale AI, an advanced AI image tools app, with a dark theme and purple accents. The page should include:

1. A hero section with a large title "FluxScale AI", subtitle "Transform Your Visuals with AI", and a futuristic background with subtle purple lighting effects. Include the domain "fluxscaleai.com" prominently.

2. A features section showcasing:
   - AI Image Generation (with an icon of a magic wand)
   - Image Upscaling (with an icon of expanding arrows)
   - Multiple Aspect Ratios (with an icon of different sized rectangles)
   - Face Enhancement (with an icon of a face with sparkles)
   - Smart Prompt Enhancement (with an icon of a brain or lightbulb)
   - High-Quality Outputs (with an icon of a star or diamond)
   - Simulation Mode (with an icon of a lab flask or test tube)

3. Two main call-to-action buttons: "Generate Images" and "Upscale Images" that stand out with a purple glow effect.

4. A section demonstrating the image generation process:
   - A text input for prompts
   - Aspect ratio selection
   - Number of outputs selection (1-4)
   - Output format selection (WebP, JPG, PNG)
   - Output quality slider
   - An "Enhance Prompt" toggle
   - A "Generate" button with purple glow
   - A grid showcasing sample generated images

5. A section showcasing the image upscaling process:
   - An upload area for images (drag-and-drop style)
   - Upscale factor options (2x, 4x, 6x, 8x, 10x)
   - A face enhancement toggle
   - An "Upscale" button with purple glow
   - Before/After comparison of an upscaled image

6. An interactive features section highlighting:
   - Follow-up Prompts
   - Image Focus functionality
   - History Navigation
   - Easy Download options

7. A tech stack section with icons for:
   - Next.js 14
   - React
   - TypeScript
   - Tailwind CSS
   - Shadcn UI
   - Magic UI
   - Framer Motion
   - Replicate API
   - Clerk (for authentication)
   - Vercel (for deployment)

8. A footer with:
   - Copyright information for FluxScale AI
   - Links to GitHub and social media
   - A "Get Started" call-to-action button
   - The domain "fluxscaleai.com"

Use a dark background (similar to bg-gray-900) with white text for contrast. Incorporate purple glowing effects and subtle animations to create a futuristic, high-tech feel. Ensure the layout is responsive and centered on the page. Add a subtle RetroGrid background effect similar to the one used in the app components.

Additional notes:
- Mention that FluxScale AI uses FLUX.1 for image generation and Real-ESRGAN for upscaling
- Include a brief section about the app's performance, mentioning rate limiting and image size optimizations
- Add a small FAQ section addressing common questions about usage and capabilities
- Include testimonials or sample images showcasing FluxScale AI's results (if available)
- Emphasize the ease of use and powerful features of FluxScale AI throughout the landing page

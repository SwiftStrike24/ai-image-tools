- think carefully about the component
- generate a prompt
- then with the prompt create a clickable link: [component name](https://v0.dev/chat?q={prompt})
- make sure prompt is url encoded
- create a new .md file in the prompts/v0 directory for each new v0 prompt, using the component name as the file name (replacing spaces with dashes(-))
- add the prompt and clickable link to the new file only.

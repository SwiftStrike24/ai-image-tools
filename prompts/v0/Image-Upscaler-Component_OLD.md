Create a modern, sleek image upscaler component with a dark mode interface and purple lighting effects. The component should include:

1. An image upload area with a drag-and-drop zone and a file selection button
2. A section for upscaling options (e.g., 2x, 4x, 8x)
3. An "Upscale" button with a purple glow effect
4. A display area for the upscaled image
5. White text on dark background for better contrast
6. Subtle purple lighting effects around key elements

Use a minimalist design with clean lines and ample spacing. Ensure the component is responsive and accessible.

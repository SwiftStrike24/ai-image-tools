Create a sleek, modern pricing component for an AI image tool application with a dark theme and purple accents. The component should showcase three pricing tiers: Free, Pro ($10/month), and Premium ($20/month). Each plan should be presented in a card format with a gradient background transitioning from dark purple to black.

Key features to include:
- Stylish plan titles with purple glow effects
- Clear pricing information with larger, bold typography
- Bulleted list of features for each plan
- Purple call-to-action buttons that pulse subtly on hover
- Visual indicators (like checkmarks or x-marks) for feature availability
- A comparison table below the cards for detailed feature breakdown

Specific plan details:
1. Free Plan:
   - 10 upscales/day & 10 generations/day
   - Upscale options: 2x and 4x only
   - 5 prompt enhancements/day
   - Basic support

2. Pro Plan ($10/month):
   - 1000 upscales/month & 1000 generations/month
   - Upscale options: 2x, 4x, 6x, 8x

   - Choice of meta-llama-3-8b-instruct or gpt-4o-mini for prompt enhancement

3. Premium Plan ($20/month):
   - 2000 upscales/month & 2000 generations/month

Include a FAQ section below the pricing cards addressing common questions about billing, feature limitations, and upgrade options. Ensure the design is responsive and maintains its aesthetic appeal on both desktop and mobile devices.
